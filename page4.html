        For this project, I believe that each individual in my class had to style our own version of the CSS Zen Garden examples. I decided to go with a Ryu, from the Street Fighter series, themed CSS. This was when I was still a beginner in styling, and I had to make some adjustments. Throughout the school year, I’ve improved on my coding skills to “level up” my websites to make them more complicated and visually appealing.

        If you click on the image, you will be sent to a project that I was apart of. The website home page of the "Digital Security" section was done by me. The website, as a whole, was composed by my whole Web Design class. Students, including myself, were split into groups of 4 and had their own subjects to write about. My group did the "Digital Security" section. There were many difficulties into making this section as my group and I had to combine our coding. To be more specific, we had to combine our CSS(Cascading Styling Sheet) into one. To solve this problem, we made classes for pretty much every object to separate our coding. In the end, it worked out well, and we ended up with a successful website to present for a showcase at CART.

        This was a slide for a presentation, as my partner and I decided to talk about red pandas. The slide was just a skeleton for the actual website that we had to make. If you scroll down, you can see what my partner and I were thinking about for setting up the website. Like any project with a partner(s), we had to collaborate with each other by communicating on who's doing what.
