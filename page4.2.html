        “Crooked Smile” was a English writing assignment that I did when I was a junior. My teacher, Ms. Perlovich, assigned me and my classmates to write about a song and explain the context within the song. I decided to choose J. Cole’s Crooked Smile because J. Cole’s music and lyrics actually have meaning to them. I ended up writing what the song itself meant to me, as an individual.

        This is part of a writing journal for “Ready Player One” that I did for an English prompt at CART. To be more specific, the journal was for chapters 20 to 22, so obviously there will some spoilers. I wanted to include this in my website as I put in a lot of effort, as I had many of these “side quests” in my personal life. I can relate to the character and felt that I had to include this entry to show my readers what type of person I am.
